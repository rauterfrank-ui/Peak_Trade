# Scripts

Scripts are organized by purpose:
- `scripts/ops/`      operator tools (doctor, audits, checks)
- `scripts/run/`      runnable entrypoints (smoke tests, runners)
- `scripts/utils/`    helper utilities
- `scripts/workflows/` PR / git helper workflows
- `scripts/automation/` automation helpers
- `scripts/dev/`      development helpers
