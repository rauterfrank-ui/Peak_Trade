PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION (Task Split)

First, read the `.agent-id` file in your working directory. If it doesn't exist yet, wait a few seconds and try again.

You will receive a TASK MATRIX with tasks 1..N.
Execute ONLY the task that matches your agent id.

When done, output:
- agent id
- what you changed
- changed files
- tests executed
- verification note
