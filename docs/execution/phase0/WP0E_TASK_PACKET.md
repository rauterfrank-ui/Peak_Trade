# WP0E — Contracts & Interfaces (Task-Packet)

**Phase:** Phase 0 — Foundation  
**Work Package:** WP0E (Contracts & Interfaces)  
**Owner:** A1 (Exec-Agent)  
**Status:** DRAFT (Docs-Only)  
**Source:** docs/execution/PEAK_TRADE_LIVE_EXECUTION_ROADMAP_MULTI_AGENT_v1_0.md (WP0E section)

---

## Scope

### In-Scope
*(A1: Fill based on Roadmap WP0E)*
-

### Out-of-Scope
- Code implementation (deferred to implementation run)
- src/ or tests/ modifications
- Live enablement or activation instructions

---

## Definitions / Glossary

*(A1: Add key terms if needed; otherwise remove section)*

---

## Proposed Components

*(A1: List types, protocols, interfaces to be implemented. Purely descriptive - no code.)*

### Component 1: *(name)*
**Purpose:**  
**Responsibilities:**  
**Interfaces:**

---

## Inputs / Outputs (Contracts)

*(A1: Define what this WP consumes and produces)*

### Inputs
- *(e.g., strategy signals, market data)*

### Outputs
- *(e.g., Order type, Fill type, RiskResult type)*

---

## Failure Modes & Handling

*(A1: High-level failure scenarios + mitigation strategies)*

### Failure Mode 1: *(name)*
**Scenario:**  
**Impact:**  
**Mitigation:**

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Gate-Tauglich)

*(A1: Testable/verifiable criteria for implementation run)*

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

---

## Evidence Checklist

*(A1: What evidence must be produced in implementation run?)*

- [ ] Evidence artifact 1 (e.g., contracts smoke report)
- [ ] Evidence artifact 2 (e.g., unit tests for types)

---

## Integration Notes

*(A1: Dependencies to other WPs, integration sequence)*

**Depends On:**  
- *(e.g., WP0E is foundation; no dependencies)*

**Consumed By:**  
- *(e.g., WP0A, WP0B, WP0C, WP0D all depend on WP0E contracts)*

**Integration Sequence:**  
- *(e.g., WP0E must be implemented first)*

---

## Next Implementation Run

**Note:** This is a docs-only specification. Code implementation follows in separate PR.

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Implement types/protocols in `src/execution/contracts.py` (or appropriate module)
- [ ] Write unit tests in `tests/execution/test_contracts*.py`
- [ ] Generate evidence report in `reports/execution/contracts_smoke.json`
- [ ] Create completion report: `docs/execution/WP0E_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`

**WP0E Task-Packet Status:** INITIALIZED (awaiting A1 completion)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31 (A0 initialization)
