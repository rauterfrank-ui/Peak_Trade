# P61 — Online Readiness Contract v1

This phase defines **what "ONLINE" means** operationally:
- Paper + Shadow only
- Deterministic run, reproducible evidence pack
- Live/Record remains hard-blocked unless explicitly enabled through policy gates (P49/P50)

Deliverables:
- Readiness contract + checker
- Ops entrypoint for paper/shadow readiness run
- Tests + runbook
