# Risk Modules (Architecture)

Status: PLACEHOLDER (reference target)

This document exists to satisfy `docs-reference-targets-gate` and will be expanded
into a proper architecture overview.

## Intended contents (TBD)
- Risk layer module map (packages, responsibilities)
- Runtime risk decisions and policy evaluation flow
- Interfaces between execution, risk, and reporting
- Operator controls and governance gates

## Notes
- Replace this placeholder with a real architecture description once the module map
  is finalized.
