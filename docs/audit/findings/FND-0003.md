# FND-0003: Multiple Execution Paths - Documentation Needed

## Metadata
- **Severity:** P3 Low
- **Subsystem:** Execution / Architecture
- **Discovered:** 2025-12-30
- **Status:** **FIXED** ✅
- **Fixed Date:** 2025-12-30
- **Phase:** Architecture Inventory (A1) → Remediation (Agent D)

## Description

The codebase contains **two separate execution modules** with similar purposes:
1. `src/execution/` - 23 files - Main execution pipeline
2. `src/execution_simple/` - 9 files - Simplified execution

**Observed Structure:**
```
src/execution/
  ├── pipeline.py         (ExecutionPipeline class)
  ├── [22 other files]

src/execution_simple/
  ├── [9 files]
```

**Questions:**
- When is `execution/` used vs `execution_simple/`?
- Is `execution_simple/` for backtesting and `execution/` for live?
- Are both actively maintained?

## Impact

**Why this matters:**
- Developer onboarding: unclear which module to use
- Maintenance: two codebases for similar functionality
- Risk of using wrong execution path in live trading

**Failure Mode (Low Probability):**
- Live path accidentally uses simplified executor missing critical checks
- Feature implemented in one path but not the other

**Severity Justification (P3):**
- This appears to be an organizational/clarity issue
- Live path clearly uses `ExecutionPipeline` from `src/execution/`
- No evidence of confusion in critical paths (yet)

## Evidence

- **Evidence ID:** EV-1002
- **Location:**
  - `src/execution/` - 23 files
  - `src/execution_simple/` - 9 files
  - Architecture overview: `docs/audit/evidence/snapshots/architecture_overview_20251230.md`
- **Code Reference:**
  - Live path uses: `from ..execution.pipeline import ExecutionPipeline` (`src/live/shadow_session.py` line 56)

## Remediation Plan

### Proposed Fix

**P3 - Low Priority (Nice to have for clarity):**

1. **Documentation:**
   - Add README.md to `src/execution_simple/` explaining its purpose
   - Document in architecture docs when each is used
   - If `execution_simple/` is deprecated, mark it clearly

2. **Code Audit (Optional):**
   - Review if `execution_simple/` is still needed
   - Consider consolidation or deprecation if not actively used

### Owner
[TBD - Architecture Team]

### Due Date
[TBD - Post-live, P3 priority]

### Verification
- [x] ✅ README.md created for `src/execution/` (production, full-featured)
- [x] ✅ README.md created for `src/execution_simple/` (legacy, simple)
- [x] ✅ Clear recommendation: Use `src/execution/` for new code

### Resolution: READMEs clarify that execution/ is production-ready, execution_simple/ is legacy. Evidence: EV-9005

## Related Items

- **Related Findings:**
  - FND-0002 (Dual risk systems)

- **Related Risks:**
  - None critical

## Notes

**Low severity because:**
- Live path clearly uses `src/execution/` (verified in code)
- No evidence of confusion or bugs from this structure
- Likely intentional design (simple vs full-featured)

**This is a documentation/hygiene finding**, not a correctness or safety issue.
