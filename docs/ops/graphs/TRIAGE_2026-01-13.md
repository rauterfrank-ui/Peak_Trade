# Docs Graph Triage Report — 2026-01-13

**Status:** Baseline Snapshot Analysis  
**Scope:** Docs-only / Ops tooling (no runtime impact)  
**Operator:** See [Remediation Runbook](../runbooks/RUNBOOK_DOCS_GRAPH_TRIAGE_AND_REMEDIATION.md)

| **Broken Targets** | 181 | ⚠️ Requires triage |
| **Broken Anchors** | 7 | ⚠️ Requires triage |
| **Orphaned Pages** | 610 | ⚠️ Requires triage |

**Context:**  
Post-merge snapshot after runbooks frontdoor reintegration (PR #706, PR #707). This is the first comprehensive baseline for the docs graph health initiative.

## Definitions

### Broken Target
A **broken target** is a markdown link reference that does not resolve to an existing file within the repository.

**Common root causes:**
- **`file not found`**: Target file was moved, renamed, or deleted
- **`outside repo`**: Relative path resolves outside repository boundaries (e.g., `..&#47;..&#47;..&#47;file.md`)
- **`invalid path`**: Malformed or syntactically invalid path

### Orphan
An **orphan** is a markdown document within the tracked scope that is:
1. Not referenced by any other document in the graph
2. Not explicitly declared as a root node (entry point)

**Why orphans matter:**  
Orphaned docs cannot be discovered via navigation and may contain outdated information or duplicate guidance.

## Top 25 Broken Targets (Grouped by Root Cause)

### 1. File Not Found (~165 instances)

**Root Cause Class:** Missing or renamed target files

**Top Patterns:**
- Phase closeout summaries (e.g., `PHASE4E_CLOSEOUT_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`)
- Moved `.cursor&#47;rules&#47;*.mdc` files (expected in repo root)
- Historical implementation reports no longer in canonical locations
- Renamed runbooks (e.g., old runbook naming conventions)

**Example:**
- Source: `PHASE4E_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`
- Target: `PHASE4E_CLOSEOUT_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`
- Reason: File was renamed or consolidated into another doc

**Remediation Priority:** **HIGH**  
These represent active documentation gaps where readers hit 404s.

---

### 2. Outside Repo (~15 instances)

**Root Cause Class:** Relative paths that escape repository boundaries

**Top Patterns:**
- `..&#47;..&#47;..&#47;PHASE6_STRATEGY_SWITCH_SANITY_EVIDENCE.md`
- `..&#47;runbooks&#47;RUNBOOK_PHASE6_...md` (from docs expecting parent traversal)
- Source docs written before docs directory structure was finalized

**Example:**
- Source: `PHASE6B_RELINK_SUMMARY.md`
- Target: `..&#47;..&#47;..&#47;PHASE6_STRATEGY_SWITCH_SANITY_EVIDENCE.md`
- Reason: Relative path escapes repo root

**Remediation Priority:** **MEDIUM**  
These are likely leftover from restructuring; most can be fixed with path corrections.

---

### 3. Malformed Paths (~1 instance)

**Root Cause Class:** Syntax errors or placeholder paths

**Example:**
- Source: `PHASE6B_RELINK_SUMMARY.md`
- Target: `..&#47;runbooks&#47;RUNBOOK_PHASE6_...md` (literal `...` in path)

**Remediation Priority:** **HIGH**  
Clearly a placeholder that was never replaced.

---

## Top 25 Orphaned Pages (Grouped by Doc Area)

### 1. Root (Project Files) — ~400 instances

**Pattern:** Phase implementation reports, PR summaries, operator guides in root directory

**Examples:**
- `.PR_PHASE0_SUMMARY.md`
- `BACKUP_AUDIT_CONSOLIDATED_REPORT.md`
- `CURSOR_TIMEOUT_TRIAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `DOCS_FRONTDOOR_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `DOCS_GATES_OPERATOR_PACK_V1_1_DELIVERABLE_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_KUPIEC_POF.md`
- `MERGE_LOG_TOOLING_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
- `PHASE_AI_AUTONOMY_LAYER_MAP_V1_SUMMARY.md`
- All `PHASE*_IMPLEMENTATION_*.md` files
- All `PHASE*_CHANGED_FILES.txt` files
- All `WP*_*.md` files

**Why Orphaned:**  
These are historical artifacts, closeout reports, and operator summaries that were never integrated into the main documentation navigation tree.

**Remediation Options:**
1. **Archive** → Move to `docs&#47;ops&#47;_archive&#47;phase_reports&#47;`
2. **Link from index** → Create a "Historical Context" or "Project Timeline" page
3. **Delete** → If superseded by canonical docs and no longer needed

**Remediation Priority:** **LOW-MEDIUM**  
No operational impact, but clutters root directory. Archive candidates.

---

### 2. docs/ops/ — ~150 instances

**Pattern:** Merge logs, PR bodies, implementation summaries in `docs/ops/`

**Examples:**
- Numerous `PR_*_MERGE_LOG.md` files
- `EVIDENCE_*.md` entries not linked from EVIDENCE_INDEX
- Historical operator checklists

**Why Orphaned:**  
Merge logs are generated artifacts; many are linked from EVIDENCE_INDEX but not from main docs navigation.

**Remediation Priority:** **LOW**  
These are archival by nature. Verify EVIDENCE_INDEX completeness; otherwise archive old entries.

---

### 3. docs/ops/runbooks/ — ~30 instances

**Pattern:** Specialized runbooks not yet cross-linked

**Examples:**
- `RUNBOOK_AI_AUTONOMY_4B_M3_CONTROL_CENTER_*.md`
- `RUNBOOK_PHASE*_CURSOR_MULTI_AGENT.md`
- Incident-specific runbooks

**Why Orphaned:**  
Newly created or specialized runbooks not yet linked from `docs&#47;ops&#47;runbooks&#47;README.md` or parent navigation.

**Remediation Priority:** **MEDIUM**  
These should be discoverable. Link from runbooks index or relevant parent docs.

---

### 4. docs/ (Top-Level Docs) — ~20 instances

**Pattern:** Standalone guides or installation docs

**Examples:**
- Various architecture or design docs
- Alternative quickstart guides

**Why Orphaned:**  
Not linked from main `docs/` README or workflow frontdoor.

**Remediation Priority:** **MEDIUM**  
If still relevant, link from appropriate index. Otherwise, archive.

**Effort Legend:** S = Small (<1 hour), M = Medium (1-4 hours), L = Large (>4 hours or requires coordination)

## Safe Rendering Rules (Token Policy Compliance)

Per Peak_Trade Token Policy, **illustrative paths in documentation must be escaped** to avoid triggering path-semantics in tooling.

### Inline Code Escaping
When rendering paths in inline-code contexts (backticks), escape `&#47;` as `/`:

**Example:**
- ❌ BAD: `` `docs/ops/README.md` ``
- ✅ GOOD: `` `docs&#47;ops&#47;README.md` ``

### Code Blocks
Literal paths in triple-backtick code blocks (shell commands, YAML) do NOT require escaping:

```bash
# This is fine - literal command
cat docs/ops/README.md
```

### Why This Matters
The token policy prevents AI agents from misinterpreting illustrative paths as actionable file operations. Escaping is required only for *inline-code documentation examples*, not for actual code or commands.

## Triage Outputs

Auto-generated detailed lists (updated by triage script):

- **Broken Targets:** [`broken_targets.md`](snapshots/2026-01-13/broken_targets.md)
- **Orphaned Pages:** [`orphans.md`](snapshots/2026-01-13/orphans.md)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Operators:** Review remediation backlog and prioritize based on:
   - User-facing impact (broken links in quickstart > obscure phase reports)
   - Ease of fix (path corrections > structural refactors)

2. **Phase 9B:** Implement top-priority fixes (see backlog table above)

3. **Ongoing:** Re-run triage after each docs PR to track progress:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/ops/pt_docs_graph_triage.sh
   ```

4. **Target State:** <50 broken targets, <200 orphans (achievable by Q1 2026 end)
