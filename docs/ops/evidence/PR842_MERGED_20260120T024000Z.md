# Evidence — PR #842 MERGED (D7 Wave 1 token-policy burn-down)

Date: 2026-01-20T02:40:00Z  
Scope: docs-only (bounded Wave 1 token-policy illustrative inline-code encoding)  
PR: https://github.com/rauterfrank-ui/Peak_Trade/pull/842  
Merge-Commit: `408bd9ea0c952784671d5b65f121b06e21ec30da`  
Risk: LOW  

## Notes
- CI initially failed docs-token-policy-gate on 3 inline-code tokens:
  - logs&#47;telemetry_health_snapshots.jsonl
  - reports&#47;quarto&#47;
  - results&#47;
- Patched and re-run: all checks PASS (docs gates, audit, CI health gate, Cursor bugbot)
- Wave 1 edits: 10 docs files, illustrative inline-code spans only; fenced code blocks untouched.
