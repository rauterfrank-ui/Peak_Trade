# PR #62 – FINAL REPORT

## PR Meta
- **PR:** #62
- **Title:** chore(ops): add post-merge PR final report automation
- **URL:** https://github.com/rauterfrank-ui/Peak_Trade/pull/62
- **State:** MERGED ✅

## Scope Summary
- **Files changed:** 4
- **Net diff:** +351 / -2

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ **Security Scan:** No BiDi/hidden unicode characters detected (per operator verification)
- ✅ **CI Fixes:** Updated expectations for *research-stub mode* behavior (flat signals `0`)
- ✅ **Safety:** Research strategies remain stubbed for safety; no live execution behavior introduced
- ✅ **Offline Data:** GARCH-regime `OfflineRealtimeFeedV0` + data safety gate integrated
- ✅ **Package Exports:** Lazy-loading `__init__.py` exports for `src/data/feeds/` and `src/data/safety/`

## Key Behavioral Change
- **Research-stub mode:** affected research strategies now return **flat signals (`0`)** by design (safety-first).

## Files Changed
- `docs/ops/PR_61_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `docs/ops/README.md`
- `scripts/automation/_update_ops_readme_audit_index.py`
- `scripts/update_pr_final_report_post_merge.sh`

## Validation Summary

## Safety Notes

- 🧯 **Safety-first defaults:** Research strategies remain non-actionable (flat signals) unless explicitly promoted via governance.

## Post-Merge Notes
- ℹ️ The post-merge PR report finalize automation was not present on main at merge time; added now via ops tooling.
