# PR #792 — MERGE LOG

## Summary
- PR: #792 (`https://github.com/rauterfrank-ui/Peak_Trade/pull/792`)
- Title: docs(ops): add PR #791 merge log
- State: MERGED
- Merged at (UTC): 2026-01-18T10:46:55Z
- Merge commit: e4c10e938112be44bd389298b9329b6653ec61ba
- Mode: Docs-only, snapshot-only, NO-LIVE

## Why
- Close the merge-log-chain for PR #791 (Docs Reference Targets Trend PASS evidence) to preserve auditability: Evidence → Merge Log → Merge-Log-Chain.

## Changes
- Added:
  - `docs/ops/merge_logs/PR_792_MERGE_LOG.md`

## Verification
- CI (PR #792): all required checks PASS (incl. docs-token-policy-gate, docs-reference-targets-gate, docs diff guard, audit, CI Health Gate (weekly_core), bugbot).

## Risk
- Low. Docs-only merge log addition; no runtime paths changed.
