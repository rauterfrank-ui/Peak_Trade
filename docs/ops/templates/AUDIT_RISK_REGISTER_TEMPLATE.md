# Audit Risk Register Template

> **Template Note:** This is a template for tracking audit risks. All `[TBD]` placeholders should be replaced with actual risk data. This template is **NOT** a live risk register—use it to generate session-specific or ongoing risk registers.

## Risk Register Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Register Name** | [TBD(e.g., "Q1 2026 Audit Risk Register")] |
| **Owner** | [TBD(risk owner or audit lead)] |
| **Scope** | [TBD(system, phase, or audit area)] |
| **Date Created** | [TBD(YYYY-MM-DD)] |
| **Last Updated** | [TBD(YYYY-MM-DD)] |
| **Review Frequency** | [TBD(e.g., weekly, monthly)] |

## Risk Assessment Scale

### Likelihood
- **Low (1):** Unlikely to occur (< 10% probability)
- **Medium (2):** May occur occasionally (10-50% probability)
- **High (3):** Likely to occur (> 50% probability)

### Impact
- **Low (1):** Minor impact, easily recoverable
- **Medium (2):** Moderate impact, requires effort to recover
- **High (3):** Severe impact, significant operational disruption

### Risk Score
**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**
- **1-2:** Low priority
- **3-4:** Medium priority
- **6-9:** High priority (immediate attention required)
