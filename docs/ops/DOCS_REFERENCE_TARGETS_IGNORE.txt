# Docs Reference Targets - Ignore Patterns
# =========================================
# This file defines patterns for markdown files/paths that should be excluded
# from reference target validation in FULL-SCAN mode.
#
# Format:
#   - One pattern per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns are matched against file paths relative to repo root
#   - Supports glob patterns (*, **)
#
# Note: These patterns are ONLY applied in full-scan mode.
#       CI mode (--changed --base origin/main) is NOT affected.

# Legacy worklogs - historical documentation, paths may be outdated
docs/_worklogs/**

# Archive directories - historical content not maintained
docs/archive/**
archive/**
